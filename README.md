# **Proud Snowflake Notebooks**

This repository serves as a backup for Snowflake notebooks created by Proud. Since Snowflake occasionally fails to save notebooks reliably, this repo provides a more secure and structured way to store and manage scripts.

## **Getting Started**
1. Browse the repository and download individual `.ipynb` files.
2. In **Snowflake Notebooks**, select **"Import .ipynb"** when creating a new notebook.
3. Load the script and start running your queries.

## **Experiments on Access Control**
If you are an **Account Admin** and want to learn **how Snowflake's access control works**, check out the **Experiments on Access Control** notebook. It contains practical scripts and examples for managing roles, privileges, and permissions.
